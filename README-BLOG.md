## Security

The blog system includes XSS protection and follows security best practices:
- All content is HTML-escaped before rendering
- URL parameters are properly encoded
- No dangerous JavaScript functions (eval, innerHTML with user data)
- Static files only - no server vulnerabilities

**Important**: Protect your GitHub account with 2FA since that's the only way to modify content.

See `SECURITY.md` for detailed security information and best practices.
